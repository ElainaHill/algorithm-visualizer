# AI-Powered Sorting Visualizer

Welcome to the AI-Powered Sorting Visualizer! This project is a visual representation of popular sorting algorithms powered by AI. It provides an interactive way to visualize how different sorting algorithms work, with the added feature of an AI-driven algorithm selector based on the data's characteristics.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Algorithm Selection**: Automatically selects the best sorting algorithm based on the current array.
- **Real-time Sorting Visualization**: Visualizes the sorting process in real-time using animated bars.
- **Interactive UI**: Easily generate new random arrays and watch them get sorted.
- **Multiple Algorithms Supported**: Supports multiple sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Insertion Sort.

## Algorithms

This project currently supports the following sorting algorithms:

- **Bubble Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**

Each algorithm is visualized with real-time animations to help you understand how each algorithm works.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/algorithm-visualizer.git
   cd algorithm-visualizer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start the development server, and you can access the project at `http://localhost:3000`.

## How to Use

- **AI Algorithm Selector**: Click the "AI Pick Algorithm" button, and the AI will automatically select the best sorting algorithm for the current array.
- **Generate New Array**: Click the "New Array" button to generate a new random array and visualize it getting sorted.
- **Visualizations**: Watch the sorting process unfold with animated bars representing array elements.
